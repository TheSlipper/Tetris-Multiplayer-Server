SYNOPSIS
       shutdown [-] [--] [-n] [-t SPECIFIED_TIME] [-s EXIT_STATUS]

DESCRIPTION
	The shutdown utility provides an automated shutdown procedure for superusers to nicely notify users when the system is shutting down, saving them from system administrators, hackers, and gurus, who would otherwise not bother with such niceties.
       
	The following options are available:
       
	-n                   shuts down the system now
       
	-t=SPECIFIED_TIME    
		Shuts down the system after a given time in miliseconds
       
	-s=EXIT_STATUS
		Shuts down the system with a given status number
       
	now
		Shuts down the system now

EXIT STATUS
    The shutdown utility exits with true on success (and schedules the shutdown and the shutdown status) or exits with false if an error occurs.
