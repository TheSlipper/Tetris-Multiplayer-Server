**DESCRIPTION**
       `man` - formats  and  displays the on-line manual pages for Tetris
        multiplayer commands. If you specify section, man only looks in that 
        section of the manual. Name is normally  the name  of  the manual page,
        which is typically the name of a command, function, or a file. 
        See below for a description of where man looks for the manual page files.

**EXIT STATUS**
    The *man* command exits *true* on success (and prints the formatted manual
    to the screen), and false if an error occurs.
